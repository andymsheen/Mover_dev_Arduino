# Mover Tools 

Mover was originally prototyped on the Arduino IDE, using Roger Clark's STM32duino port.

The hardware is based upon Leaflabs Maple Mini, using an STM32F103C8T6 as the MCU. This allows to be initiated into DFU mode,
allowing the device to reprogram itself.

## Peripherals 

The Mover uses [APA102](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar) (Also known as Dotstars) and [LSM303AGR](https://github.com/andymsheen/LSM303AGR_Arduino)

Links to libraries, implementation self explanatory
